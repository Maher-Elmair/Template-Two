# 🎨 Template Two - Leon Landing Page

📌 This is my **second web development project**, created after following tutorials and practicing with video lessons.
It helped me strengthen my understanding of **HTML and CSS** by applying layout techniques, responsive design, and typography.
This project built on what I had learned in my first template and gave me more confidence in creating structured, reusable code.

🗓️ **Project Created:** Monday, November 22, 2021
